Student Data Management System
This project is a simple Student Data Management System implemented in C++. It allows you to add, display, clear, and search student data using a command-line interface. The student data is stored in a CSV file (studdata.csv) for persistence.

Features:
1. Add Student Data: Add a new student's information to the database and save it to a CSV file.
2. Display Student Data: Display all student information currently stored in the database.
3. Clear Student Data: Clear all student data from the database and the CSV file.
4. Search by ID: Search for a student by their ID and display their information.
5. Persistent Storage: The student data is stored in a CSV file, ensuring that data is not lost when the program is closed.

Prerequisites:
• A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC, Clang)
•Basic knowledge of C++ programming and command-line interface usage
